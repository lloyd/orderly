Orderly is a textual format for describing JSON. Orderly can be compiled into JSONSchema. It is designed to be easy to read and write.

This repository contains lots of different things:

* Documentation and a grammar for the textual schema language, orderly. (see `docs.md`)
* A reference implementation of a parser than can cross compile between JSONSchema and Orderly
* The orderly-json.org website (see the `website` branch)
